# Tic-Tac-Toe - A Windows Forms Project

[![Changelog and Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Downloads-v0.0.67--beta-blue.svg)](https://github.com/DanielKng/Tic-Tac-Toe/releases)

---

Started as a school project, ended in being multiple times bigger than assumed. 
The main task was to create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, which can handle all typical Tic-Tac-Toe ends.

## Features
- Main Menu with various Options
- Playernames
- A winning and losing Animation
- Change your playernames on the fly

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] Stats
- [ ] Savegame
- [ ] Colors
- [ ] AI
- [ ] Reworked Images
- [X] Changelog

Some features, such as savegames, may seem useless - and they are. But this Project is more a learning task for me and others. So please keep that in mind!

## Screenshots
Please keep in mind that the Images will be reworked!
